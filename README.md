<p>Welcome to my GitHub page! Currently pursuing a <strong>Master's degree in Political Science</strong> at <strong>McGill University</strong> as an Eren Graduate Fellow, I am an incoming PhD student at <strong>Cornell University's Department of Government</strong>. 
<p>
My interest in the mechanisms at work in the formation and evolution of political attitudes in <strong>Quebec, Canada</strong> and the <strong>United States</strong> has been the driving force behind my academic aspirations, as well as the common thread of my theoretical and quantitative training. My research is currently supported by the <i>Fonds de recherche du Québec – Société et culture </i> (FRQSC) and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC).</p>


<p>
  I previously received a
  <a href="https://pol.umontreal.ca/programmes-cours/premier-cycle/baccalaureat-science-politique/" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Bachelor's degree in Political Science (Hons.)</a> 
  and completed an undergraduate certificate  in 
  <a href="https://admission.umontreal.ca/programmes/microprogramme-de-1er-cycle-en-analyse-des-megadonnees-en-sciences-humaines-et-sociales/" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Big Data Analytics and Computational Social Science</a> 
  from Université de Montréal (UdeM). My academic journey also took me to the University of Washington (Seattle) as a 
  <a href="https://www.fulbright.ca/programs/killam-fellowships/canadians/recent-award-recipients" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Fulbright-Killam Fellow</a>, 
  an experience I hold in high regard.

    <h3>Research Interests</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
        My research interests extend to inquiries surrounding 'welfare chauvinism', the determinants of solidarity, the influence of exogenous shocks on electoral choices, and the spectrum of political attitudes towards redistribution within the North American context.
