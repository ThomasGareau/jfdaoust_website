Welcome to my website! I am a PhD student in the **[Department of Government](https://government.cornell.edu/)** at **Cornell University**.

Prior to Cornell, I pursued a [Master's degree in Political Science](https://www.mcgill.ca/politicalscience/grad/admissions/ma) at **McGill University,** as the inaugural Eren Graduate Fellow. My research was supported by the *Fonds de recherche du Québec – Société et culture* (FRQSC), the *Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada* (SSHRC) and the *[Center for the Study of Democratic Citizenship](https://csdc-cecd.ca/alumni/)*. I also hold a [Bachelor's degree in Political Science (Honours) and Data Science](https://pol.umontreal.ca/programmes-cours/premier-cycle/baccalaureat-science-politique/) from the **Université de Montréal (UdeM)**.

I am currently working with **[Prof. Valérie-Anne Mahéo](https://www.fss.ulaval.ca/notre-faculte/repertoire-du-personnel/valerie-anne-maheo)** (Université Laval) on the  *Programme Accès et Soutien à l’Intégration (PASI) et la pleine participation des personnes immigrantes* Project. In addition to my current role, I have held research positions with **[Prof. Jean-François Daoust](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/politique-appliquee/ecole/personnel/personnel-enseignant/jean-francois-daoust)** at Université de Sherbrooke, **[Prof. Dietlind Stolle](https://www.mcgill.ca/politicalscience/dietlind-stolle)** at McGill University, the **[Manifesto Project](https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/)** at the WZB Berlin Social Science Center, the **[Canada Research Chair in Electoral Democracy](https://www.chairedemocratie.com/)** at Université de Montréal, and the **[Chaire de recherche sur l’Évaluation des actions publiques à l’égard des jeunes et des populations vulnérables](http://crevaj.ca/)** at the École nationale d'administration publique.


## Research Interests

I am driven by a deep interest in the formation and evolution of political attitudes in Quebec, Canada, the United States, and other post-industrial democracies. Specifically, my research interests extend to inquiries surrounding the politics of inequality, "welfare chauvinism," political attitudes pertaining to redistribution and the welfare state, as well as the political economy of housing. My methodological toolkit includes survey experiments, causal inference, and the analysis of large-scale survey data.
