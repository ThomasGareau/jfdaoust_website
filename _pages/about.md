Welcome to my website! I am a PhD student at **[Cornell University's Department of Government](https://government.cornell.edu/)**.

I previously received a **[Master's degree from McGill University's Department of Political Science](https://www.mcgill.ca/politicalscience/grad/admissions/ma)**, as well as a **[Bachelor's degree in Political Science (Hons.)](https://pol.umontreal.ca/programmes-cours/premier-cycle/baccalaureat-science-politique/)** and an undergraduate certificate in **[Big Data Analytics and Computational Social Science](https://admission.umontreal.ca/programmes/microprogramme-de-1er-cycle-en-analyse-des-megadonnees-en-sciences-humaines-et-sociales/)** from Université de Montréal (UdeM). My academic journey also took me to the University of Washington (Seattle) as a **[Fulbright-Killam Fellow](https://www.fulbright.ca/programs/killam-fellowships/canadians/recent-award-recipients)**, an experience I hold in high regard.

My research has been supported by the *Fonds de recherche du Québec – Société et culture* (FRQSC) and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC).

I was a student researcher at the **[Center for the Study of Democratic Citizenship](https://csdc-cecd.ca/alumni/)**, where I had the opportunity to collaborate with amazing scholars across several institutions. Currently, I work with **[Prof. Valérie-Anne Mahéo](https://www.fss.ulaval.ca/notre-faculte/repertoire-du-personnel/valerie-anne-maheo)** on the  *Programme Accès et Soutien à l’Intégration (PASI) et la pleine participation des personnes immigrantes*, based at Université Laval.

Previously, I held research positions with **[Prof. Jean-François Daoust](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/politique-appliquee/ecole/personnel/personnel-enseignant/jean-francois-daoust)** at Université de Sherbrooke, **[Prof. Dietlind Stolle](https://www.mcgill.ca/politicalscience/dietlind-stolle)** at McGill University, the **[MARPOR](https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/)** (WZB Berlin Social Sciences Center), the **[Canada Research Chair in Electoral Democracy](https://www.chairedemocratie.com/)** (Université de Montréal), and the **[Chaire de recherche sur l’Évaluation des actions publiques à l’égard des jeunes et des populations vulnérables](http://crevaj.ca/)** (École nationale d'administration publique). Each of these experiences has uniquely contributed to my understanding and perspective on democratic processes and political behaviour, in Canada and beyond.


## Research Interests

I am driven by a deep interest in the formation and evolution of political attitudes in Canada, the United States, and other post-industrial democracies. Specifically, my research interests extend to inquiries surrounding the politics of inequality, "welfare chauvinism," political attitudes pertaining to redistribution and the welfare state, as well as the political economy of housing. My methodological toolkit includes survey experiments, causal inference, and the analysis of large-scale survey data.
