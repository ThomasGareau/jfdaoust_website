Welcome to my website! I am a PhD student at **[Cornell University's Department of Government](https://government.cornell.edu/)**.

I previously received a **[Master's degree from McGill University's Department of Political Science](https://www.mcgill.ca/politicalscience/grad/admissions/ma)**, as well as a **[Bachelor's degree in Political Science (Hons.)](https://pol.umontreal.ca/programmes-cours/premier-cycle/baccalaureat-science-politique/)** and an undergraduate certificate in **[Big Data Analytics and Computational Social Science](https://admission.umontreal.ca/programmes/microprogramme-de-1er-cycle-en-analyse-des-megadonnees-en-sciences-humaines-et-sociales/)** from Université de Montréal (UdeM). My academic journey also took me to the University of Washington (Seattle) as a **[Fulbright-Killam Fellow](https://www.fulbright.ca/programs/killam-fellowships/canadians/recent-award-recipients)**, an experience I hold in high regard.

My research has been supported by the *Fonds de recherche du Québec – Société et culture* (FRQSC) and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC).

As a Student Researcher at the **[Center for the Study of Democratic Citizenship](https://csdc-cecd.ca/fr/members/students-fr/?studentid=506)**, I have the opportunity to collaborate with amazing scholars across several institutions. My current research roles include working with **[Prof. Valérie-Anne Mahéo](https://www.fss.ulaval.ca/notre-faculte/repertoire-du-personnel/valerie-anne-maheo)** at Université Laval, **[Prof. Jean-François Daoust](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/politique-appliquee/ecole/personnel/personnel-enseignant/jean-francois-daoust)** at Université de Sherbrooke, and **[Prof. Dietlind Stolle](https://www.mcgill.ca/politicalscience/dietlind-stolle)** at McGill University.

I have also held research positions at the **[MARPOR](https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/)** (WZB Berlin Social Sciences Center), the **[Canada Research Chair in Electoral Democracy](https://www.chairedemocratie.com/)** (Université de Montréal), and the **[Chaire de recherche sur l’Évaluation des actions publiques à l’égard des jeunes et des populations vulnérables](http://crevaj.ca/)** (École nationale d'administration publique). Each of these experiences has uniquely contributed to my understanding and perspective on democratic processes and political behavior.

## Research Interests

I am driven by a deep interest in the formation and evolution of political attitudes in Canada, the United States, and other post-industrial democracies. Specifically, my research interests extend to inquiries surrounding regionalisms, the educational cleavage, the politics of inequality, "welfare chauvinism," and political attitudes toward redistribution.
